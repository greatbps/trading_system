## üìù Decisions & Notes

### **Core Architecture Decisions**
*   **Database:** Exclusively using PostgreSQL. SQLite support has been removed.
*   **HTS Integration:** KIS HTS conditional search IDs are crucial for 1st-step filtering and must be configured in `.env`.
*   **Token Management:** `KISTokenManager` in `kis_collector.py` already handles token caching and refresh.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Leveraging `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for efficient API calls.

### **AI Integration Decisions (2025-08-05)**
*   **AI Provider:** Selected Google Gemini API for news analysis due to Korean language optimization and cost-effectiveness.
*   **Analysis Approach:** Replaced random sentiment values with actual AI-powered analysis for production-ready accuracy.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Developed Korean stock market-specific prompts for optimal analysis results.
*   **Integration Strategy:** Maintained backward compatibility while enhancing functionality with AI insights.
*   **Performance:** Implemented robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI service reliability.

### **News Analysis Scoring Evolution**
*   **Original:** Keyword-based scoring prioritizing long-term > medium-term > short-term impact.
*   **Enhanced:** AI-powered analysis with 5-level sentiment classification and market impact assessment.
*   **Investment Grades:** Added 13-level investment grading system (A+ to D-) based on AI analysis.
*   **Trading Strategies:** AI now suggests specific trading strategies (AGGRESSIVE_BUY, MODERATE_BUY, etc.).

### **Development Philosophy**
*   **AI-First Approach:** All new features should leverage AI capabilities where beneficial.
*   **Reliability:** AI enhancements must include fallback mechanisms for system stability.
*   **Modularity:** AI components are designed as optional enhancements, not dependencies.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive testing required for all AI-integrated components before deployment.
